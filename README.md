## Some things about this project: 

- I developed an interactive information retrieval system that provides real-time data for a specified zip code or city.  

- Designed an instance of PircBot using event driven architecture to present data via web interface such as Libera Chat, enabling on-demand access to weather information.

- Incorporated JSON objects to facilitate data transfer from client/server and parsed the data to extract relevant data and user-specified locations. 

## How it works:

1. open up https://web.libera.chat/ and enter #weatherapi into the channel name
2. Run the program and watch the bot welcome you in!
3. Name a city or zipcode in the US to get their weather information 
4. The bot will save you the effort and gather that information for you!
