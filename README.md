# Weather-API

Hey there and welcome to a fun API project I did using Libera Chat!

I Developed an interactive information retrieval system that provides real-time data for a specified zip code or city.  

I was able to Designed an instance of a PircBot using event driven architecture to present data via web interface such as Libera Chat, enabling on-demand access to weather information.

It alao incorporates JSON objects to facilitate data transfer from client/server and parsed the data to extract relevant data and user-specified locations. 

How it works:

1. open up https://web.libera.chat/ and enter #weatherapi into the channel name
2. Run the program and watch the bot welcome you in!
3. Name a city or zipcode in the US to get their weather information 
4. The bot will save you the effort and gather that information for you!
