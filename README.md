# Weather-API

Hey there and welcome to a fun API project I did using Libera Chat!

I had a lot of fun incorporating JSON and using IRC Bots to make the project more interesting.

How it works:

1. open up https://web.libera.chat/ and enter #weatherapi into the channel name
2. Run the program and watch the bot welcome you in!
3. Name a city or zipcode in the US to get their weather information 
4. The bot will save you the effort and gather that information for you!
